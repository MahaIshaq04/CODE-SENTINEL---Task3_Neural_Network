📌 CODE SENTINEL – Task 3: Neural Network
📝 Description

This is Task 3 of the CODE SENTINEL series.
In this project, I implemented a Neural Network using TensorFlow/Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

The notebook covers:

Data preprocessing

Building a Sequential Neural Network

Training & evaluation

Accuracy and loss visualization

📂 Dataset

MNIST dataset (handwritten digits 0–9)

Automatically available in tensorflow.keras.datasets

⚙️ Technologies & Libraries

Python 🐍

TensorFlow / Keras

Matplotlib

🚀 Steps

Load & preprocess MNIST data

Build a neural network using Keras Sequential API

Compile the model with optimizer & loss function

Train the model on training data

Evaluate accuracy on test data

Plot accuracy and loss curves

📊 Results

Achieved ~98% accuracy on test data ✅

Plotted training vs validation accuracy and loss

▶️ How to Run

Clone this repo

git clone <your-repo-link>
cd CODE_SENTINEL-Task3_Neural_Network


Install dependencies
